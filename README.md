### Deviation from the original implementation
  1. ~~Use [group normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494) instead of layer normalization in upscaling blocks.~~ 
      - Model using group norm failed on reconstructing edge images of edges2shoe dataset.
  2. Use [mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) technique for training.
  3. Input/Output sizes are 128x128.
  4. Use only 3 res blocks (instead of 4) as default in content encoder/decoder in order to reduce training time. 
      - However, I'm worrying that this decreases the receptive field size so that the output quality becomes worse.
  
### Environment
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  
### Result
  - **Edges2shoes** (config. 1)
    - **Cyclic reconstruction loss weight = 1** for the first 80k iters and 0.3 for the rest.
    - Trainin iterations: ~130k
    - Optimization: Use [mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) technique for the first 80k iters.

  - **Edges2shoes** (config. 2)
    - **Cyclic reconstruction loss weight = 10**
    - Training iterations: ~70k
    - Optimization: Use [mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) technique for the entire training process.

    - Model performs better (generates more detail and clearer edges) on guided translation when using high reconstruction loss?
